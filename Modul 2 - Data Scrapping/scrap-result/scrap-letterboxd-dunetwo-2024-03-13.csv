cassiasimone8,12 Mar 2024,CINEMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sahil,12 Mar 2024,Dune: Part Two is techinal film-making at its finest. 
Mace,13 Mar 2024,"I’m obsessed. I love this one more than first. The cinematography is breathtaking. The soundtrack is perfect. The actors are incredibly talented. The production is unreal. Everything about it is beautiful. I’m in love. The ending was abrupt, but hopefully there will be a third, otherwise I might start a riot."
Micha Jetter,13 Mar 2024,"Ton im Kino war eindeutig zu laut, aber als man die Vibrationen der Ornithopter im Sessel gespührt hat, wars schon kurz ganz geil."
Emm,13 Mar 2024,Vista 09/03
darcy,13 Mar 2024,need to be intoxicated by worm piss and think i’m the messiah
nolamaley,13 Mar 2024,The Bene gesserit should absolutely be in charge of casting for the bachelor
Mchugh1993,13 Mar 2024,"This movie alone, I seen it three times in the cinemas and it is literally the most beautiful film with an great cast and a great story! "
calebsycamore99,01 Mar 2024,I found out after watching this I might be the Lisan al Gaib (I also dream of Zendaya and Anya-Taylor Joy)
Maxence Barneix,13 Mar 2024,LISAN AL-GAIB !
Robin Whalley,11 Mar 2024,God only knows how much fun Javier Bardem had making this.
Vibhor Sharma,13 Mar 2024,"Epic is what comes to mind after watching this. Just amazing, Denis Villeneuve is the best when it comes to directing films that are unconventional. What a blast!"

Jacksontackett,12 Mar 2024,"Rumor has it Feyd-Rautha is still immersed in his role as Elvis, what a bald little inspiration!"
Holly Hazelwood,11 Mar 2024,Christ! That was fucking EPIC!!
JabbaK,13 Mar 2024,Dennis does it again. Timothee and Butler were exceptionally good

Enta,13 Mar 2024,Lady jessica's sooo me!!! (i believe i have prophetic dreams and i lie)
mirr,13 Mar 2024,Such a pleasant theater experience
abybaby,13 Mar 2024,Having read the book (basically water of life) I can see now that the path to paradise was so very narrow and Villeneuve has threaded the needle. Most things are improved from the books and I'm guessing the omitted parts will play a big role in the next movie cause they don't have a big part in this story yet.
Germano Gonçalves,12 Mar 2024,#8
jackdeichert,10 Mar 2024,Haven’t had this much in a theater in such a long time. There were moments where I was giddy with excitement. See it on the biggest screen you can. It should also be mentioned that this picture was made for a fraction of what a Marvel movie is made for and blew them all out of the water quality-wise. 
Ephraim Stites,13 Mar 2024,Watching space guerrilla warfare on the big screen fulfills a carnal male desire. Despite this Dune 2 felt rushed as many details of the work are lost in translation from novel to film. Still the back bone of the film is found in the stunning visuals and on screen effects. I don’t understand why Elvis and Rue from Euphoria are in this though.
Thommy98,13 Mar 2024,"This was a fun watch. The movie is quite a long one. But time flew by anyway. Visually it is amazing. The story is a bit more complex to follow sometimes. And you really shouldn't drift off for a moment, otherwise you potentially will miss a important part of information of the movie. But it is the first movie this year (2024) that i have rated with five stars. "
Silvia C,12 Mar 2024,"Molto bello.Forse poteva tipo metterci un po' MENO trama qua dentro, che sono cinque storie in uno? Espertə di Dune non mi odiate."
Tom Merison,13 Mar 2024,"This planet must have an itchy anus, cause it’s GOT WORMS! "
danielbower,13 Mar 2024,"""Don't be shocked by the tone of my voiceCheck out my new weapon, weapon of choice"""
The Smash Hit Chronicles,12 Mar 2024,"Dune Part Two is a monumental achievement in modern filmmaking. With its stunning visuals and stellar performances, it cements Denis Villeneuve's status as one of the premier directors of his generation. Fans of the Dune saga will undoubtedly be thrilled by this faithful adaptation, while newcomers will be drawn in by its epic scale! This film is nothing short of a cinematic triumph and earns a well-deserved appreciation throughout."
Haleigh,12 Mar 2024,Whenever something inconvenient or dramatic happens in my life I’m just gonna go “aaaayaaaayaaa” like the soundtrack in this
taaha69,13 Mar 2024,Lisan Al gaib

lunacrsco,11 Mar 2024,toujours écouter javier bardem
owen,13 Mar 2024,Here before it sweeps the oscars
kpoki,13 Mar 2024,"So much better than the first one, cause the first one is just a setup. The music is great, the acting is amazing, the story is great, the visuals are stunning. This makes me excited for future dune movies. I didn't want it to end."
bella,09 Mar 2024,this was the most fun ive had in a cinema in actual years and it was just the absolute best
markg88,13 Mar 2024,Dune 2 is the definition of cinematic masterpiece with every scene adding to the climax of the movie. Every character introduce into this world with such care. You can tell the director took this franchise with care and importance. It is a must watch for years to come
Fábio M,12 Mar 2024,"For certain, the soundtrack sticks back with scale.Definitely need to watch the movie again."
Diana,12 Mar 2024,I think the feeling I’ll get when I see my first borns take their first steps will be the same feeling as me seeing Paul Atreides ride his first sand worm.
Gingernut,13 Mar 2024,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.
Gio,13 Mar 2024,👍🏻
ohshitchris,13 Mar 2024,The dune franchise is a representation to how it was like growing up in Dubai…
floragdr,13 Mar 2024,"Photographie et sons encore une fois incroyables, meilleures scènes indiscutablement avec les Harkonnen et Austin ButlerDéçue du perso de Zendaya, pas bien développé, basic love interest c dommage"
ineslgt,13 Mar 2024,"Le 1 était soporifique as fuck donc je ne m’attendais à rien mais j’ai finalement bien aimé et j’ai même hâte de voir la suite, ça fait plaiz de replonger dans une saga"
Thom,13 Mar 2024,Best sound design i have ever experienced in a theater. Must see in atomos. What a film.

dazy030,10 Mar 2024,an absolute masterpiece
Carson Hilton,13 Mar 2024,"One of the single most creative movies I’ve seen. The sense of scale, the set design, Hans Zimmer’s score, the shots, the acting, everything was so cohesive to give such a specific “otherworldy” feel, somehow even more so than Part One. "
Julia Rachel,09 Mar 2024,Incredible. Amazing. Mind blowing. Heartbroken I have wait a whole century before the next one comes out.
blackice83,13 Mar 2024,This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.
tmoej,13 Mar 2024,i also had a similar experience where i did too many drugs and i thought i was the messiah.
lexi3103,13 Mar 2024,Just a masterpiece
inops98,10 Mar 2024,absolute cinema
Coreyoc,13 Mar 2024,One of the most impressive feats this film manages to achieve is to capture you within the environment. I was there. I don’t think I can say that for many films. I feel this comes down to the attention to detail and precision with which everything is carried out. You can really feel the passion and care that went into the film. It wasn’t a rushed process and everything from the VFX to sound to acting is done with love. Roll on number three!
alissmrn,13 Mar 2024,"great soundtrack. meh fight scenes. i love timothee but the acting when he’s trying to be intimidating just doesnt work for me, especially when he stomped his foot."

kaspernls,13 Mar 2024,extremely confusing and drastically changing scenario at all time. However AMAZING visuals and good acting
jenan,13 Mar 2024,"hot- even 3 hours felt not long enough; i want to be immersed in this world forever, hot- lea seydoux, hot - austin butler is a fun villain, hot- stilgar drinking that tear from jessica’s face, hot"

ashley,13 Mar 2024,"woah again!not only was this even better the second time around, i also got to watch it while sitting 3 rows behind david dobrik and my personal lisan al gaib, noah beck. who knew they were dune heads just like me? was also very fun to watch with jonny and getting to see his reactions to everything that was so majorbut anyways i guess i promised a real review this time… but honestly i am just so in…"

Patrick L,12 Mar 2024,"Teil 2 von Dune ist ein Beispiel für einen großartigen Film, bei dem auf viel Licht leider auch eine Menge Schatten trifft. "
Bear,13 Mar 2024,"It somehow improves upon on the magic and spectacle of the first one; it feels like the parts and lore of the first movie are moving in a natural and captivating succession.The battle of prophecy & coincidence is such a strong and gripping through line, Paul’s savvy in seeing through this & his political action afterwards makes sense even if the pacing can seem odd the writing was on the walls."
isavenus,12 Mar 2024,"é o lisan al-gaib porra não tem jeito, FILME DO ANO"

Andrii Andriychuk,,"Theatrical. Spiritual. Archetypal. Still, predictable and somewhat boring."
Gregoose,10 Mar 2024,"On sait que Denis s’aime bien hein, et sur Arrakis, clairement ça mousse beaucoup. Alors oui c’est très joli, l’ambiance visuelle et sonore est vraiment prenante et réussie. Mais est-ce qu’on retient autre chose de cette adaptation qui franchement n’est pas aussi aboutie que tout le monde aime à dire ?"

samham,07 Mar 2024,"I planted my feat flat on the ground, this imax experience was utterly insane. It felt as if I was there, on that fuckEN WURM. I got a tease of that when I saw the re-release of the first movie last month in the post credits. It was so awesome. "
HotteokFist,07 Mar 2024,“모래바람 마저 느껴질 정도의 생생함과 눈으로 느끼는 압도감”
katedixon008,13 Mar 2024,I really can’t fault the gorg music and scenes ! The black and white scene was insane!! Timmy and Zendaya just give me no chemistry and all their scenes felt so cringe and unnatural to me sorryyy  also the film reminded me of avatar a lil bit dare i say

Kaknaque,13 Mar 2024,"Une œuvre cinématographique magistrale, y’a tout, une direction artistique visionnaire (costumes, décors, lumière 10/10), et des performances remarquables Austin Butler flippant en Majin Buu, Souheila Yacoub qui nous sort une performance en parlant une langue inventée, c’est trop fort. Le film est vraiment immersif et captivant en explorant des thèmes comme le pouvoir et la religion avec subtilité et intelligence. Bref un chef-d'œuvre incontournable de la science-fiction moderne."
EllioDubs,13 Mar 2024,"Cinematic spectacle. Visually it’s amazing, and the pacing of the film is easy to flow with. However, my only gripe is that something is missing. I feel many people will get swept away with how great this movie looks or makes you feel, but the actual content is missing certain links to bring the story together."
Tomgamer,13 Mar 2024,I actually really liked this movie

tylersimon,12 Mar 2024,"Visual masterpieceSo many things going on in one frame, it’s a masterclassThe relationship can be a bit thin but ends on an enticing noteIt’s a good thing Butler put up a fight because the other Harkonnens went out like bitchesVery curious where this goes given the melange of religion, drugs, and nukes — and as of this movie the messaging would be that those things are a good mix?"

wongkarwayed,10 Mar 2024,very bollywood core mid story but great cinematography <3
Newton M,09 Mar 2024,A behemoth of a film. This is going to linger in the back of my mind for the rest of my life. Denis Villeneuve is making sci-fi history and I am so here for it. This is possibly the most important sci-fi film franchise since Star Wars. Villeneuve has earned his place as one of the greatest directors of all time. Had to give this one a couple days to sit on till I wrote something about it.

nathaniel,13 Mar 2024,"absolutely blown away. coming into this film with almost no expectations, wondering how they could top the first one, to say i was surprised would be an understatement. Denis Villeneuve knocks it out of the park with this one. nothing could’ve prepared me for what was almost 3 hours of a stellar film that literally had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. the goat Hans Zimmer again with an amazing soundtrack, crazy fight scenes, and a gripping plot that had me hooked the entire time, this will be a film that will go down in history as the new sci fi classic."
thefilmexplorer,10 Mar 2024,"One of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen. The sound and music were fantastic they really tied it all together. The world building was incredibly well done I felt like I was transported to each location every time the scenes changed. My favourite part however has to be the costuming, it was detailed, distinct and clearly well made and tailored to each character. Their clothes did such a great job to communicate changes in the movie such as time, comfort and influence."

The action scenes are rare, but when they happen, they are epic, technically implemented at the highest level and thrilling.What once again sets Villeneuve's film apart from other blockbusters is the visual story telling.

But then there are these small but subtle problems that make it difficult for me to call this film adaptation a masterpiece. The OV does solve some problems that I still had with the German synchro. But the point remains…"

Anthony_Esteban,13 Mar 2024,"The craze about his movie just doesn't compute with me. It's dumb, long, and boring. I love Villeneuve's body of work, but his Dune doesn't move the needle for me. Of course it doesn't help that the source material is incredibly overrated to begin with."
francis_faye,13 Mar 2024,I have not had an experience watching a movie in the theatre's like this in a veryyyyy long time. That was absolutely incredible.
fluffypython,13 Mar 2024,What the frooks
matmanning,12 Mar 2024,"Second half of an incredible movie, amazing cast & set piece action. Big budget sci-fi done amazingly well. Sought out an IMAX in Hanoi while travelling, worth it. See it in IMAX⏳"
HandmadeMatt,13 Mar 2024,Seeing this in 4D and my seat literally moved when he kissed zendaya.
utkuugurluoglu,13 Mar 2024,"sinemada izlenmeyi net hakediyor. ilk partin soru isaretleri, pek anlasilamayan evreni ve olay orgusu bu partla cok daha iyi oturdu."
Nic Hall,13 Mar 2024,I know there is another film scheduled but i really hope Denis does what Nolan did when he alternated Batman movies with non-batman movies
AlexElSancho,13 Mar 2024,Excellent mais Nolan aurait trouvé des vrais Shai uluds et aurait fait peter une vraie nuke sur le gros lard pour un peu + de réalisme (c’est pas un concours Villeneuve masterclass tabarnak)
daggerwitch,12 Mar 2024,"A 3 hour lore-filled movie that builds off of the first movie. Stunning visuals, amazing worldbuilding, and a cast that makes you point and say 'I know that guy/girl!'"
Veena,09 Mar 2024,Perfection

Victor Sauce,13 Mar 2024,"I don't know, maybe movies just get boring and feel like a waste of time once you start having an actually interesting life with adventures, wood chipping etc.. Forgot that it is sometimes worth going to theatres though, this is good but I just got angry because I just wanted to go tramping the whole time. once again, not sure why because this is about a big desert which is a boring place for a tramp but just trapped atm with a fractured shoulder and little timmy gets to run down sand dunes ooh la la la I'm the prophet. Whatever"
Gábor Nádai,12 Mar 2024,"Monumentális? Abszolút. Lenyűgöző a látvány szinte minden képkockán? Egyértelműen. Eposzi a történet? Nem lehetne jobban az. Benne van majdnem az összes jelenleg menő és nagyon szép ember (mégha a filmben nem is a szépségük az első, ami szembetűnik)? Szintén igen. "
DarthJager,12 Mar 2024,"Saw it in ScreenX this time, just to see how it’d be. And yup, it’s still the gimmick that almost delivers but never fully does. "
Ace789,13 Mar 2024,I’ll need some time to collect my views and articulate my thoughts about this film and I’ll edit this but until then.
Meischen_,13 Mar 2024,“Holy Mother!” Exactly! 
jackmacmovies,12 Mar 2024,"have seen it twice now, and after the first viewing i thought the pacing was a bit messy. with a second watch, the vision really came together and is well executed"
Lou Aquiler,13 Mar 2024,"Yeah dude, I mean…this rules. There’s so much dope stuff.  IMAX is a crazy experience."
Tonagi,13 Mar 2024,Stilgar may be the GOAT hypeman

aahtiss,09 Mar 2024,"everything from the pacing and scenes compared to the first movie was truly intriguing i found myself constantly curious of what would happen next the soundtrack was absolutely perfect for each of the scenes, truly captivating the intensity and eerie feeling in certain moments and the CAST was wonderful W movie. I didn't remember a thing from the first movie but this movie was so well made and immersive that you could enjoy it without much context from the first. Truly an amazing movie going experience cannot stress it enough"
Alexah,13 Mar 2024,We played the soundtrack otw home and pretended my Nissan was a sand worm. Messiah shit.  Anyways breakups are always rough.

linse 🦆,13 Mar 2024,"this was truly an expirience in theaters I am so glad I catched it in the cinema.stunning visuals, intriguing character developements ... this whole world is just so interesting to me and this is coming from someone who is not a huge fan of the sci-fi genre at all!"
Aleksandre_L,13 Mar 2024,"It hardly seems worthwhile to discuss the visual aspects; every artificial intelligence manages better, and indeed, we had already seen painters and cinematographers creating better ocular works even before AI. If you still find your jaw dropping throughout, you're likely either very new to art and cinema or miraculously maintained an unblemished gaze—for which I envy you. Nonetheless, there's nothing particularly new or captivating here. Speaking of visuals, have you seen Mad Max? Though not a masterpiece, it outshines this…"
